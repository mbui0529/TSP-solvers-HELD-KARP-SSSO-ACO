# CS584 Final Project
Student name: Matthew Bui

Instructor: Daniel Leblanc

Project name: Ant Colony and State Space Search Optimizers For TSP

This project tries to compare performances of the different approaches solve TSP.
 - Held Karp
 - Ant Colony Optimizer (ACO)
 - State space search Optimizer (SSSO)
 
 Held Karp implementation is inherited from:
 https://github.com/CarlEkerot/held-karp
 
 ACO implementation is inherited from:
 https://github.com/pjmattingly/ant-colony-optimization
 
 SSO is implemented by myself.
 
 The experiment is implemented separately. So to run it, compiled them individually.
 
 The results of experiments 2, 3, 4 are written to csv files.
 
 The results of experiments 1, 5 is printed in the console.
 
 The experiment descriptions are defined in the report.
